In this guide, we will be detailing the initial configuration of your Plex Media Server. This assumes the following:

1. You have stored your media in `~/media`

***

## Prerequisites

* A Plex account - you can make one at https://plex.tv
* A Plex supported Ultraseedbox plan
* Plex Pass - This is optional but is required if you want to take advantage of GPU acceleration for Pro NVMe Streaming Plans.

## Initial UCP Configuration

Like all applications Plex Media Server is installed from the Ultraseedbox Control Panel, this application however has one extra step. When you click on Install and are prompted with this screen you will need to visit [https://www.plex.tv/claim/](https://www.plex.tv/claim/)

If you have not done so already, sign into your Plex account and copy the claim code provided. Paste this into the prompt and then click Install.

Your Plex Media Server is also configured out of the box. Just connect to your Plex Media Server instance by following the link in the UCP - as is normal with all your other applications.
