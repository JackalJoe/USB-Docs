In this guide, weâ€™ll be setting up Medusa for the first time. This guide assumes that this is your first time installing Medusa and you'll be storing your media locally, saving to `~/media/TV Shows`. 

We will be doing the following:

 1. Add root folder
 2. Connecting your download clients and setting their completed download directories for Medusa Post-Processing
 3. Adding indexers/search providers
 4. Configure Post-Processing
 5. Adding your first series

::: info
Its important to be sure only your **COMPLETED** downloads are in this location, otherwise Medusa's Post-Processor may import incomplete media and cause errors. You may refer to the [Medusa Download Client Connection Details](https://docs.usbx.me/books/medusa/page/download-client-connection-details) to set completed directories for your download clients to this location
:::

* You will need to set the **Processing Method**:

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/scaled-1680-/img-2232223433.png)

* **Processing Method: HARD LINK**
  * This method is recommended if you are using local storage on your seedbox.
    * Hard Links effectively creates a file that points directly to your source file in the disk. You can do anything to this file without affecting your source file and vice versa. This is useful when you're seeding from torrents.
      * This is to prevent to have 2 copies of the same media without affecting your files.

* **Processing Method: COPY**
  * This method is required if you are using a separate file system mount such as *mergerfs*.
    * Hard Links does not work on mounts, so Copy is recommended in the case that you have a mount.
    * For this, consider using [Rclone VFS and MergerFS Setup](https://docs.usbx.me/books/rclone/page/rclone-vfs-and-mergerfs-setup)

If your torrent trackers have archives, it would be recommended to enable Medusa's **Unpack** feature:

* To save your **Post Processing** settings, click on the **Save Changes** button below the provider list, and then click the **Save Changes** button in the lower-left corner.

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/scaled-1680-/img-2239722223.png)

* For the **Post Processing scheduler** to be enabled, you *must* restart Medusa. You can do this easily by hovering your mouse pointer over the **Configuration Tool Icon** and then click on **Restart**
