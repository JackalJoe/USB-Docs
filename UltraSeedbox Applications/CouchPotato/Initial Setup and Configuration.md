In this guide, we'll be setting up CouchPotato. This guide assumes that this is your first time installing Radarr and you'll be storing your media locally, saving it to `~/media`.

A setup wizard will assist you in setting up your CouchPotato.

***
## Initial Setup
### CouchPotato Setup Wizard

* After installation and clicking Connect, enter your credentials. After that, CouchPotato's Setup Wizard will start. Just scroll down the page to continue.
