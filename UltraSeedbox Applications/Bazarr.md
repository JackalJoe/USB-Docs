Bazarr is a companion application to Sonarr and Radarr that manages and downloads subtitles. Some of the features of this app are the following:

* Downloads subtitles automatically using your set subtitle sources, languages, etc.
* Automatically scans and upgrade previously downloaded subtitles
* Integration with Sonarr and Radarr

Be aware that Bazarr doesn't scan your seedbox to detect series and movies: It only takes care of the series and movies that are indexed in Sonarr and Radarr.
