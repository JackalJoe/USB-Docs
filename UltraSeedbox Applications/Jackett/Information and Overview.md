Jackett is a proxy server for torrent trackers and your apps. It acts as the middleman, translating queries from your apps (e.g. Sonarr, CouchPotato, etc.) to be sent and received by your trackers. It allows for getting recent uploads via RSS and performing searches from within your apps, even those without RSS feeds or is not supported by your apps.

For more information on this app, refer to the app's [GitHub page.](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett)
