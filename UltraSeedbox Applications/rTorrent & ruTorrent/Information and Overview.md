rTorrent is a text-based ncurses BitTorrent client written in C++, based on the libTorrent libraries for Unix, whose author's goal is "a focus on high performance and good code". It is known to be stable and can handle a large number of seeding torrents, making it a solid choice for long-term seeding.

ruTorrent is a popular front-end for rTorrent which is used to interact with rTorrent. It was designed to emulate the look and feel of µTorrent WebUI so its appearance is quite similar to the "parent". The name "ruTorrent" is the combination of µTorrent and rtorrent. The original version of ruTorrent was based on an older version of µTorrent Webui but has been completely rewritten as of 3.0.
