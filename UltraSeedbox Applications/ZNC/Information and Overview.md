ZNC is an IRC network bouncer or BNC that is written in C++. It can detach the client from the actual IRC server, and also from selected channels. Multiple clients from different locations can connect to a single ZNC account simultaneously and therefore appear under the same nickname on IRC. It has the following main features:

* SSL secured connections
* ZNC will remain connected to IRC even while you are offline
* Multiple users support
* Per Channel Playback Buffers
* Modules support
