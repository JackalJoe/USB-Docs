**Jellyfin** is a Free and Open Source Media System that is forked from Emby's 3.5.2 and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support. It is slowly becoming one of the great alternatives to closed sourced solutions such as Plex, Emby and Kodi as a way to serve media from our slots to you via multiple apps.
