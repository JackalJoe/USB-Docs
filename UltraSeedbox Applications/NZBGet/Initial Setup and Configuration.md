Here, we'll be setting up NZBGet for the first time. In this guide we'll be doing the following tasks:

* Login to the NZBGet instance for the first time
* Change ControlUsername and ControlPassword
* Add Usenet indexers

You may also need the following: 

* A Usenet service provider, you can find a list of different providers here:Â [https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/providers](https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/providers)
* An indexer to obtain `.nzb` files, these are used to tell the server where to find the files

***

## Initial Setup
### First Login

* After installation, run the commands below in SSH. This is to ensure that NZBGet is pointed to the correct folders in your slot.

```sh
sed  -i "s|MainDir=/downloads|MainDir=$HOME/.config/nzbget|g" "$HOME"/.apps/nzbget/nzbget.conf
app-nzbget restart
```

* Upon clicking connect, you'll be greeted by this window. Enter the default credentials shown below

</p>

* Change both fields to your preferred credentials.
  * Please make sure that the username and password you chose is unique and is not used in any of your accounts
* Scroll down a bit to find **FormAuth** then click **yes**
  * FormAuth allows you to login via login credentials on the webpage instead of the basic browser popup. This is particularly useful for password managers as some do not auto-fill basic browser popups.
  * This is a recommended step. You may opt to skip this if you prefer the default behavior, which is basic auth.
