Post-processing scripts (pp-scripts) on NZBGet help in further processing your downloaded files after downloading and unpacking such as the following:

* Deleting unwanted files
* Renaming and sorting releases
* Unlocking password-protected archived files

In this guide, we'll be showing you how to setup and enable Post-processing scripts for NZBGet. 

***

## Creating NZBget Scripts Folder

* Login to your seedbox's SSH and run the following command to create the `scripts` subfolder inside nzbget's config folder:

```
mkdir -p "$HOME"/.apps/nzbget/scripts
```

## Downloading Scripts

* After that, just put any scripts that want on your newly created folder in `"$HOME"/.apps/nzbget/scripts`
  * The next section contains some of our recommended scripts.
  * In this guide, we'll be installing `flatten.py`.
