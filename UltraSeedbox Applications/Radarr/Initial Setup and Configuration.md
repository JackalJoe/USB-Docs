In this guide, we'll be setting up Radarr. This guide assumes that this is your first time installing Radarr and you'll be storing your media locally, saving it to `~/media`. We'll be doing the following:

1. Enabling Automatic Organization
1. Adding indexers
2. Connecting your download clients
3. Adding your first movie

***

## Initial Setup
### Enabling Automatic Organization

* Access and login to your Radarr instance using the credentials you set during installation
* Go to **Settings**

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581325500386.png"></p>

* Make sure that advanced settings is set to **Shown**

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-01/scaled-1680-/image-1579696379682.png"></p>

* In Media Management settings, toggle Rename movies to **Yes**.
  * You can leave the rest of the options as-is. The defaults work well with Plex's naming scheme.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-01/scaled-1680-/image-1579697177402.png"></p>

* Make sure that **Use hardlinks instead of copy** is set to **yes**.
  * Hardlinks effectively creates a file that points directly to your source file in the disk. You can do anything to this file without affecting your source file and vice versa. This is useful when you're seeding from torrents.
    * This is to prevent to have 2 copies of the same movie without affecting your files.
      * If your root folder is located on a mount (eg using a rclone mount), you should set this to **No**.
        * Hardlinks does not work on mounts. Sonarr will resort to copying, which is prone to errors.
        * For this, consider using [Rclone VFS and MergerFS Setup](https://docs.usbx.me/books/rclone/page/rclone-vfs-and-mergerfs-setup)

* After changing, save it by clicking **Save**.

### Adding Indexers

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581328790022.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-01/scaled-1680-/image-1580041005728.png"></p>

* Then select the indexers you want to add for your Radarr instance and input what is asked on each indexer you wish
  * Depending on the indexer, it'll ask for your account credentials or a passkey. Refer to your indexer/tracker for more information on what to put.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581328858875.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581329498414.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581329854483.png"></p>

* Select `homexx` folder where `homexx` contains the node where your seedbox is in.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581335780157.png"></p>

* Once opened, select your seedbox (indicated by your seedbox username)

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581335888900.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581336654541.png"></p>

* After selecting the path, you may set the other preferences accordingly
  * Monitor
    * Choose yes if you want Radarr to monitor your indexers for better releases and upgrade them accordingly
  * Min. Availability
    * This sets when Radarr will search your indexers for movies.
    * The general tip here is that if you're in great trackers, you can opt to choose Announced. If you're not sure, choose Physical/Web
  * Profile
    * This sets what quality/resolution Radarr will grab.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-02/scaled-1680-/image-1581336706270.png"></p>

## Settings Overview

### Media Management

* This is where you can customize Radarr's media organization settings. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1575378441455.png"></p>

### Profiles

* Here, you can edit profiles for different resolutions.
* Each profile you can set which resolution you'd like to grab, the cutoff to which you'll set Radarr to stop grabbing releases of that episode and any custom formats you've wished to grab.
* You can also set Delay profiles
  * Delay profiles allow you to reduce the number of releases that will be downloaded for an episode, by adding a delay while Radarr will continue to watch for releases that better match your preferences.
  * These are also helpful if you want to emphasize one protocol (Usenet or Torrent) over the other.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1575378468237.png"></p>

### Quality

* Here, this is where you'll control the size limits of each resolution. Anything that's not within the set limits will be rejected from releases.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1575378491000.png"></p>

### Custom Formats

* Custom formats are a way to further filter down the releases from your indexers. These are extremely customizable and can be used to further filter down the releases that you want.
* You may refer to the wiki page indicated in the settings for more information about custom formats

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1575385565137.png"></p>

### Indexers

* This is where Radarr will grab releases from. You can set your preferred tracker and/or Usenet indexers.
* You may also set some options on how frequent you check your torrents, your torrent minimum age and set your restrictions.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1575387799248.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1576941090578.png"></p>

### Connect

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1576941155204.png"></p>

### Metadata

* This is where you can generate metadata (NFO) files to be used by some applications. It holds information on the media you downloaded such as Movie name, Banner/Poster links, Description, etc. which is read and displayed by the application for you.
* All of our supported media center apps can generate its own metadata files so there's no real need to enable one of the options although, it'll speed up library rescanning since it won't need to search and match metadata from online sources.

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-12/scaled-1680-/image-1576941189116.png"></p>
