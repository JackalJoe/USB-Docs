This guide will teach you how to install Deluge plugins. Deluge plugins extend the functionality of what Deluge provides, giving you more ways to automate processes or simplifying tasks. Take note that you need to check what plugin you download. Specifically:

*   If the plugin is written for Deluge v.1.3.15
*   It's written using python 2.7
*   Its extension isÂ `.egg`

Also take note if your plugin can be accessed with the thin client or the web client.

## Installing Plugins

* Login to your Deluge's Client
* Download the plugin that you want.
* Go to **Preferences -> Plugin**.
* Click Install Plugin and navigate to your `plugin_name.egg` and click **Open**
  * This'll install the plugin on your PC client and to the Seedbox Client.
  * After it's installed, tick the label name and click OK. You may have to do that a few times to get it properly installed.
