# Setting up AutoRemovePlus

* Once installed, go to AutoRemovePlus. You'll see 2 tabs, which are described below

## General

* Here, you can set your general settings of the plugin. This applies to all of the torrents, current and future torrents. The relevant settings are as follows:
  * Enable
    * Enables the plugin
  * Check Every
    * This sets the interval for the plugin to check Deluge's loaded torrents
    * For example, to check every 24 hours, set it to `1`. To check every 6 hours, set it to `0.25`
  * Maximum torrents
    * This sets the maximum amount of loaded torrents. Once the number of torrents exceeds the set value, it'll remove the torrents that meets the minimum criteria.
    * For example, setting this to `0` removes every torrent. Setting it to `250` removes every torrent when the total loaded torrents is above 250.
  * Minimum HDD Space
    * This sets the minimum HDD space.
    * When disk space goes lower than the value set, it removes the torrents that meets the criteria until it reaches the minimum HDD space value set.
    * If set to `-1`, it will disable this option.
