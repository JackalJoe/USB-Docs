Nextcloud is a free and open-source suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. It was a fork of ownCloud and it has been actively developed by some of the original developers of ownCloud. In contrast to proprietary cloud providers like Dropbox, Office 365 or Google Drive, Nextcloud enables users to deploy their own file hosting server and have full control of their data.
