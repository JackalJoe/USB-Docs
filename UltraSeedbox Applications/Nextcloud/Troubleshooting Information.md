#### I am unable to upload files more than the size of 10MB on Nextcloud. How to resolve it? 

This is a default limitation of your nginx instance, as it is not needed by most of our clients. Run the following command to your slotâ€™s shell to be able to upload more than 10MB.

```sh
sed -i 's|client_max_body_size .*;|client_max_body_size 0;|g' "$HOME"/.apps/nginx/nginx.conf && app-nginx restart
```
