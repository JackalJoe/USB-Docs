All Ultraseedbox plans have complimentary HTTP Proxy included. HTTP Proxy is used for quickly circumventing blocks or to quickly anonymize your connection by acting as a gateway between you and the internet, sending all of your web requests to your slot first before going to the site.

If you need to completely anonymize and encrypt your connection, you may look into our [VPN service](https://docs.usbx.me/books/virtual-private-network-%28vpn%29) instead.

This guide shows you how to use the HTTP proxy by using a browser extension to quickly set and switch proxy servers.

## Initial Setup
### Changing your HTTP Proxy Password

Before logging into your HTTP Proxy, you should first set your own HTTP Proxy password.

* Login to your [User Control Panel](https://cp.ultraseedbox.com) and login with the credentials you set and Press **Connect**

  * At least 12 characters
  * An uppercase letter
  * A lowercase letter
  * At least 1 number
  * At least 1 symbol
* When you're done click **Confirm change**

### Installing and Setting Up Proxy SwitchyOmega

There are many software/extensions to use the HTTP proxy. Here, we'll be using Proxy SwitchyOmega. This extension allows you to switch your HTTP proxy settings on the fly.

* Download and install the extension to your browser
  * [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif)
  * [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchyomega/)

* Once installed, a new tab opens up. Click **Skip Guide** to close the welcome window.
