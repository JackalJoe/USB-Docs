In this guide we will be doing a migration of your data from your previous slot to your new slot, and then restoring the configurations and data to your respective applications.

We will be using SSH most of this guide, if you are unfamiliar with SSH we have a detailed guide located here: [How to connect to your seedbox via SSH](https://docs.usbx.me/books/secure-shell-%28ssh%29/page/how-to-connect-to-your-seedbox-via-ssh)

***

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you have an SSH password set for **both**  slots in your UCP. Login to your [User Control Panel](https://cp.ultraseedbox.com) and login with the credentials you set and Press **Connect**

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-10/image2019-5-7_11-13-9%5B1%5D.png)

* Click **Access details** and click **Change password** beside SSH access.

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-10/image2019-5-7_11-14-38%5B1%5D.png)

* Set your password to anything you wish. We recommend using a unique password that you do not use in any of your existing accounts and has the following
  * At least 12 characters
  * An uppercase letter
  * A lowercase letter
  * At least 1 number
  * At least 1 symbol
* When you're done click **Confirm change**

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-10/image2019-5-7_11-19-3%5B1%5D.png)

* A popup saying *Password successfully changed* should appear on the lower right corner of the page, signifying that the password is set successfully.

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2019-10/image2019-5-7_11-25-0%5B1%5D.png)
* If you have a very large plex Instance, please follow the section regarding large plex before anything else in the guide.

* If possible, it is recommended to stop your applications on your original slot while doing the transfer. This will help prevent possible changes in data during the transfer, and will likely assist with the actual data migration speeds to run as intended.
* Also, you may want to stop any rclone/mergerfs mounts as a precaution.

***

## Migration of Data to the New slot
### Transfer Preparation

Using `rsync` in SSH, we will be making a 1:1 copy of your original slot to your upgraded slot in a directory named transfer located in your upgraded slot's home folder.  We will use a utility called `screen` for this because the processes run in a `screen` will continue to run even if you close your local SSH terminal.

* Log into your fresh **UPGRADED** slot's SSH service
* Open a new screen named "transfer" with the following command

```sh
screen -S transfer
```

### rsync Transfer Proper

The following is our optimized for transfer rsync command to start your migration. This will make a complete 1:1 copy of the original slot's data to a folder named transfer in the destination slot.

**rsync transfer command *template*:**

```sh
rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --info=progress2 --delete-after --bwlimit=20000 --no-i-r -e "ssh -T -c aes128-ctr -o Compression=no -x" username@lw##.usbx.me:. transfer
```

* The only variables you will need to change here are in `username@lw##.usbx.me`
  * username = your **ORIGINAL** slot's SSH username
  * lw##.usbx.me = your **ORIGINAL** slot's server URL

So for example, if the username was `usb555` and the slot server was `LW850.usbx.me` where the original slot would be transferring my data *from*, then the transfer command would be the following

**rsync transfer command *example*:**

```sh
rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --info=progress2 --delete-after --bwlimit=20000 --no-i-r -e "ssh -T -c aes128-ctr -o Compression=no -x" usb555@lw850.usbx.me:. transfer
```

After you have copied the `rsync` transfer command with your **ORIGINAL** slot details, you will be prompted for your **ORIGINAL** slot SSH password, after you have entered your password press ENTER to start the migration.

This initial step of `rsync` "receiving file list ..." may take some time to complete depending on the file/folder count, but rest assured the transfer will proceed to the next step of actually transferring the files

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/wAOehow[1].png)

After the `receiving file list ...` has finished, you will then see the transfer commencing. This example screenshot points out where you can see your transfer % progress and the estimated time for completion.

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/DUO0cHG[1].png)

::: info
It may take some time for the rsync process to move on to larger files to actually see these values.
:::

After the transfer is completed, you will see the text stop scrolling and will resemble the example screenshot below of a completed rsync transfer

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/6QuNdeq[1].png)

After confirming your rsync transfer is completed, you can then close out of your terminal screen by entering the command

```sh
exit
```

#### Tips for Large Plex Database

If you Have a large Plex Database (Many Items) Rsync may take a very long time to create the transfer list, In this instance it is a good idea to run a slightly diffrent proceedure.

First create a screen to run a tar command to compress your Plex database.

`screen -R tar_plex`

Run the tar command in this screen with.

`tar -cvpzf plex.tar.gz .config/plex`

You can detach from this screen using `CTRL+A+D` `CMD+A+D` on Mac.

You can reattach to the screen to check progress using the command.

`screen -rd tar_plex`

Once this tar process is completed, run your Rsync command bellow to begin migration while excluding your Plex Database.


`rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --info=progress2 --delete-after --bwlimit=20000 --exclude '.config/plex' --no-i-r -e "ssh -T -c aes128-ctr -o Compression=no -x" username@lwxx.usbx.me:. transfer`

Once your transfer is completed you can extract your plex to the .config folder from your tar file with the command.

`tar -C ~/.config/ -xvzf plex.tar.gz`

You can skip the Rsync transfer mentioned in the guide and proceed to Restoring your Data




#### Some tips on how to use the `screen` utility

* If you were to disconnect from your `screen` (closed your local SSH terminal, or lost internet temporarily for example). You can recall the `screen` back with the command

```sh
screen -rd  transfer
```

## Restoration of Migrated Data

In this next section, we will be restoring your data and application configuration files on your **UPGRADED** slot.

If you have followed the above steps for migrating your **ORIGINAL** slot's data using the `rsync` transfer template command, you should now have your migrated data located in `~/transfer` on your  **UPGRADED** slot.

During this time, you may install your applications to your new slot (but do not set it up, as you will attempt to restore your configuration/data from your old slot). Once you've finished installing your applications, you may proceed to the following sections.

Refer to the Table of Contents on the left-side of this guide to jump to the relevant sections.

### Torrent Clients
#### Prerequisites

First, this restore section assumes that you have **already installed the torrent clients you plan to restore** on your upgraded slot. It is important to note here that these freshly installed torrent clients should have an **empty torrent session with no active torrents**, any current torrents that are in your clients will be removed by following this restore procedure.

* Next, you will **need** to move your torrent's downloaded data from your migration folder `~/transfer` to your current slot's `~/files`
  * If you have only used the default download location of torrents clients `~/files` then the command in SSH to move your data will be the following

```sh
mv -f ~/transfer/files/* ~/files/
```

* If you have used custom download directory locations, then you will need to move (each) from the root of your `~/transfer` to the root of your new slot home directory
  * An example to move a custom download directory that was being used in the root of the home directory on your original slot called "SpecialDownloadFolder" would be the following

```sh
mv -f ~/transfer/SpecialDownloadFolder ~
```

* It is important to note here that Linux is case-sensitive, including directory names.

***

#### Deluge

After you have moved all torrent's data to its correct locations for Deluge seeding restoration, we can now proceed to modify Deluge session files to match that of your upgraded slot home directory. To do this, first we will be using a few SSH commands to first get the original slot's **home#**, and then another command to update your migrated rTorrent session folder data files.

* First, you will need to stop your Deluge client with the SSH command

```sh
app-deluge stop
```

* Next, to get your original slot's **home#** from your migrated rTorrent session folder, enter the following SSH command into your terminal

```sh
cat ~/transfer/.config/deluge/state/torrents.state | grep home --color
```

As you can see in the screenshot example, the `home` will be colorized to make it easier to find. The value we need to note here in the example is `home8` and we will refer to this value as ***homeOLD***

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/3DD61mO[1].png)

* Now, we will need to get your upgraded slot's **home#**, this can be found with the following SSH command

```sh
pwd
```

In the screenshot example, `home34` is the current home number we will be needing, which we will refer to as ***homeNEW***

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/vx5jS3IGl8[1].png)

* Now that we have our **homeOLD** using the `cat` command, and our **homeNEW** using the `pwd` command, we we can perform a "search and replace" using `sed` to replace all occurrences of your old **home#** with your current **home#**

**sed command *TEMPLATE*:**

```sh
sed -i 's/homeOLD/homeNEW/g' ~/transfer/.config/deluge/state/torrents.state
```

* **homeOLD** would be the **home#** you noted from the `cat` command, which is your original slot home
* **homeNEW** would be the **home#** you noted from the `pwd` command, which is your upgraded slot.

**sed command *EXAMPLE*:**

```sh
sed -i 's/home8/home34/g' ~/transfer/.config/deluge/state/torrents.state
```

* Copy the torrents to where they belong with th following SSH command:  
```
cp -a ~/transfer/.config/deluge/state/* ~/.config/deluge/state/
```

* Now that we have our Deluge session data files correctly set to our current home directory, and have moved our Deluge torrent data directories to their correct place, we can restart Deluge with the following SSH command:

```sh
app-deluge restart
```

Be sure to reload your Deluge WebUI to confirm that your migrated torrents are now in the session and running as expected.

***

#### rTorrent

After you have moved all torrent's data to its correct locations for rTorrent seeding restoration, we can now proceed to modify the session data rTorrent to match that of your upgraded slot home directory. To do this, we will be using a few SSH commands to first get the original slot's **home#**, and then another command to update your migrated rTorrent session folder data files.

* First, you will need to stop your rTorrent client with the SSH command

```sh
app-rtorrent stop
```

* Next, to get your original slot's **home#** from your migrated rTorrent session folder, enter the following SSH command into your terminal

```sh
cat ~/transfer/.config/rtorrent/session/*.rtorrent | grep home --color
```

As you can see in the screenshot example, the `home` will be colorized to make it easier to find. The value we need to note here in the example is `home8` and we will refer to this value as ***homeOLD***

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/HLnouG3[1].png)


* Now, we will need to get your upgraded slot's **home#**, this can be found with the following SSH command

```sh
pwd
```

In the screenshot example, `home34` is the current home number we will be needing, which we will refer to as ***homeNEW***

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/jS3IGl8[1].png)

* Now that we have our **homeOLD** using the `cat` command, and our **homeNEW** using the `pwd` command,  we we can perform a "search and replace" using `sed` to replace all occurrences of your old **home#** with your current **home#**

**sed command *TEMPLATE*:**

```sh
sed -i 's/homeOLD/homeNEW/g' ~/transfer/.config/rtorrent/session/*.rtorrent
```

* **homeOLD** would be the **home#** you noted from the `cat` command, which is your original slot.
* **homeNEW** would be the **home#** you noted from the `pwd` command, which is your upgraded slot.

**sed command *EXAMPLE*:**

So for example, from the screenshot examples in this section, the `sed` command would be

```sh
sed -i 's/home8/home34/g' ~/transfer/.config/rtorrent/session/*.rtorrent
```

* Copy the torrents to where they belong with th following SSH command:  
```
cp -a ~/transfer/.config/rtorrent/session/* ~/.config/rtorrent/session/
```

* Now that we have our rTorrent session data files correctly set to our current home directory, and have moved our rTorrent torrent data directories to their correct place, we can restart rtorrent with the following SSH command:

```sh
app-rtorrent restart
```

Be sure to reload your ruTorrent WebUI to confirm that your migrated torrents are now in the session and running as expected.

***

#### Transmission

After you have moved all torrent’s data to its correct locations for Transmission seeding restoration, we can now proceed to modify the migrated session data for Transmission to match that of the upgraded slot home directory. To do this, first we will be using a few SSH commands to first get the original slot’s **home#**, and then another command to update your migrated Transmission session folder data files.

* First, you will need to stop your Transmission client with the SSH command

```sh
app-transmission stop
```

* Next, to get your original slot’s **home#** from your migrated rTorrent session folder, enter the following SSH command into your terminal

```sh
cat ~/transfer/.config/transmission-daemon/resume/*.resume | grep -a home --color
```

As you can see in the screenshot example, `home` will be colorized to make it easier to find. The value we need to note here in the example is `home8` and we will refer to this value as ***homeOLD***

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/Pcs8tXH[1].png)

* Now, we will need to get your upgraded slot's **home#**, this can be found with the following SSH command

```sh
pwd
```

In the screenshot example, `home34` is the current home number we will be needing, which we will refer to as ***homeNEW***.

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-10/SgnjS3IGl8[1].png)

* Now that we have our **homeOLD** using the `cat` command, and our **homeNEW** using the `pwd` command,  we we can perform a "search and replace" using `sed` to replace all occurrences of your old **home#** with your current ****home#****


**sed command *TEMPLATE*:**

```sh
sed -i 's/homeOLD/homeNEW/g' ~/transfer/.config/transmission-daemon/resume/*.resume
```

* **homeOLD** would be the **home#** you noted from the `cat` command, which is your original slot home
* **homeNEW** would be the **home#** you noted from the `pwd` command, which is your upgraded slot.

**sed command *EXAMPLE*:**

* So for example, from the screenshot examples in this section, the `sed` command would be

```sh
sed -i 's/home8/home34/g' ~/transfer/.config/transmission-daemon/resume/*.resume
```

* Copy the torrents to where they belong with th following SSH command:  
```
cp -a ~/transfer/.config/transmission-daemon/resume/* ~/.config/transmission-daemon/resume/
```

Now that we have our Transmission session data files correctly set to our current home directory, and have moved our Deluge torrent data directories to their correct place, we can restart Transmission with the following SSH command:

```sh
app-transmission restart
```

Be sure to reload your Transmission WebUI to confirm that your migrated torrents are now in the session and running as expected.
