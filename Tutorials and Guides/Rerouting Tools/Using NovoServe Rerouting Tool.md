In this guide, we'll be showing you how to use NovoServe's rerouting tool. This tool can help you reroute your connection to the most optimal route. This can help you max out your download speeds from our servers to your PC.

<c><p class="callout info">This tool only changes the route from our servers to your PC (Download). It does not have any control over the route from your PC to our servers (Upload) and is under your ISP's control. Contact your ISP and ask if they have any rerouting tools available.</p></c>

## RerouteIntel

* Visit NovoServe's Rerouting Tool here: [http://lg.novoserve.com/](http://lg.novoserve.com/)
* You should see a command prompt as shown. The prompt shows your IP address.

* Once finished, it'll show you the route chosen and how much faster the new route is compared to the worst route. By default, it is set for you to use this route for 10 days. After 10 days and you see any degradation in performance (eg. your transfers from the slot are slow, buffering issues, etc.), you may have to run RerouteIntel again.

* You can use the same route again by scrolling down the rerouting tool. You should see the `Rerouting tool` window. The available routes are shown under `Desired transit` and how long will the new route lasts under `Duration`.
* In this case, the desired Transit is Telia AMS (shown in RerouteIntel as `telia1`) and the maximum duration which is 3 weeks (21 days).
* Once that's done, click **Add reroute**. Wait for up to a minute for the rerouting tool to apply your preferred route.
