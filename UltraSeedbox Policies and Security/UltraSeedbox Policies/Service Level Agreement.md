The Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) is a policy governing the Terms and usage of Services provided by Ultraseedbox and applies individually to you by using our services.

Having in mind the nature of services (shared environment) and the kind of services we offer, server downtime is an inevitable part. With this agreement, we’ll explain how we handle certain situations during your time with us.

The objective of this agreement is to ensure that the proper elements and commitments are in place to provide consistent service to you by us and will serve as an Official Agreement for our Policy on Handling Conflicts and Offering Compensation.

## Server Downtimes, Server Maintenance & Compensation

Ultraseedbox takes all the requisite steps to ensure that our servers remain online and accessible for each user in any billing cycle. 

Any scheduled maintenance of servers will be announced in advance through various communication modes such as e-mails, Ultraseedbox Status Page & WHMCS Announcements, with pertinent details. Clients that are affected by this will not be compensated.

Any unannounced/emergency downtimes/maintenance of servers will be announced as such, and users affected will be compensated for it. Below is the basis for compensation:

Please take note that this **does not include any downtime of your apps installed.**

## Drive Failure and Data Loss

Ultraseedbox is a shared app hosting platform; almost all of the setup is devoted to providing the users with the fair allocation of resources and full disk utilization. Unfortunately, there will be inevitable incidents like drive failures.

If drive failure happens on the slot you’re in, and we’re unable to recover your data, you will be eligible for **one month of service on us.**

With this, we recommend you backup your data that’s on your slot.

Except for the above scenario, removing user data on your end with no system errors detected will not be compensated.

## Fair Use of Server Resources

Our services run on shared resources. As a result, it is the responsibility of the client to ensure that their activities do not negatively impact other client’s experiences and are kept within acceptable limitations.

Ultraseedbox may stop, without warning, any applications that are negatively affecting other clients. In extreme scenarios where clients are negatively affecting other clients, the client’s slot may be suspended or terminated.
