### Copy operation in Midnight commander (MC)

By Default all Ultraseedbox slots come with Midnight Commander installed and it
can be started as easily as connecting to your Slot via SSH and issuing the
command `mc` this will present you with Midnight commander

Midnight Commander allows you to interact with the SSH console using your mouse
so you can simply Click a folder or file you wish to navigate to. In this
example I will copy the file “Folder1file” to Folder2 using Midnight Commander.

 Once you have your Source and destination chosen you can either use the top menu bar to access options

or use the `F5` Key to issue the copy command

This will present you with the confirmation dialog and show you the path you
will copy to clicking OK or hitting enter will begin the action

As you can see “folderfile1” has now been coped to “Folder2”

### Move operations using Midnight Commander

Move works in the exact same way as the copy command the only change in the
steps is the key which is F6. You will see the same dialog box as with copying,
You may either click OK or Hit the enter key. The file will be moved from the
left directory to the right directory.
