Please make yourself aware of the Ultraseedbox Fair Usage Policy. Directly pointing Syncthing to sync your cloud storage will create extreme strain on your slot's disk and could cause a 24 hour ban on accessing your cloud storage. Please Consider Rsync or Rclone with a reasonable limit set on speed. It is _your_ responsibility to ensure usage is within acceptable limits. Ignorance is not an excuse.

**Syncthing** is a free, open-source peer-to-peer file synchronization application that's written in Go. It synchronizes files between two or more computers securely and seamlessly.

## Initial Setup

In this section, we'll be setting up Syncthing for the first time. For this guide, we'll assume you want to setup a folder on your seedbox as your "dropbox", which will be synced automatically to your Windows PC.

### Prerequisites

* Download and install Syncthing on both your seedbox and the devices you prefer. You may refer to [Syncthing Downloads](https://syncthing.net/downloads/) to get which apps to use for your preferred platform. For this guide, we'll be installing [SyncTrazor](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor) along with Syncthing on the seedbox.
* Login to your seedbox via SSH and create a folder which will be used to sync folders with. For this guide, we'll be creating a folder named `Syncthing`. Also get the full path of the folder by doing `pwd` as shown below.

```sh
usbdocs@lw873:~$ mkdir Syncthing
usbdocs@lw873:~$ ls
bin  Downloads  files  media  openvpn  >Syncthing<  watch  www
usbdocs@lw873:~$ cd Syncthing/
usbdocs@lw873:~/Syncthing$ pwd
/home20/usbdocs/Syncthing
```

::: warning
Do not attempt to mount your rclone remote directly on your home directory. This will lead to instabilities. Instead, always create and use an empty folder within your home directory.
