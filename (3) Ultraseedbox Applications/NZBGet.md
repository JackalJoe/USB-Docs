Please make yourself aware of the Ultraseedbox Fair Usage Policy. Directly pointing any NZB client to download directly to (or worse try to download and unpack) on your cloud storage using Rclone Mount will create extreme strain on your slot's disk and _WILL_ cause a 24 hour ban on accessing your cloud storage repeatedly. It is _your_ responsibility to ensure usage is within acceptable limits. Ignorance is not an excuse.
