**Emby** is a proprietary media server written in C# that organize, play, and stream audio and video to a variety of devices. Prior to Emby 3.5.3 release (and subsequently Emby 3.6 which has since been closed-source), Emby's source code was initially an open-source project with subsequent releases being released to their website are marked as proprietary. [Jellyfin](https://docs.usbx.me/books/jellyfin) is the fork of Emby prior of re-license.

## Initial Setup

In this section, we will detail the initial configuration of Emby. This assumes that you have the following:

* An UltaSeedbox service of at least Jaguar-Plex or higher
* A source for media to populate your Emby server - see [Sonarr](https://docs.usbx.me/books/sonarr) and [Radarr](https://docs.usbx.me/books/radarr)
* Your media is saved to `~/media`

The initial setup is all performed using the setup wizard so the process is relatively intuitive.

### Emby Initial Setup Wizard

* Once you installed and launch the app, the setup wizard will run. Select your preferred language to start.
  * For the purposes of this guide we will be using the English (United States) option.

    * It'll default to TV Shows and we will be leaving the default in this guide
* The default folder for TV Shows on your Ultra.cc server is `homexx/username/media/TV`

## Troubleshooting Information

**Why does Emby connect not work? Which port should I use in my Emby Client?**

Due to our infrastructure, Emby Connect doesn't work because it's looking for Emby instances on their default port (8096). You may have to just manually connect under `manually connect server` or a similar option. Listed below are the client connection details that you will enter.

### All Clients
#### SSL

```
URL: https://username.servername.usbx.me/emby
Port: Leave blank

Username: Your slot's username that you entered during signup
Servername: The lw followed by three digits (e.g. lw123)
```

#### Non-SSL

```
URL: servername.usbx.me
Port: Emby Port Under Applications -> Emby

Username: Your slot's username that you entered during signup
Servername: The lw followed by three digits (e.g. lw123)
```
