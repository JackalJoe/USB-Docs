Please make yourself aware of the Ultra.cc Fair Usage Policy. Directly pointing Nextcloud to share your cloud storage will create extreme strain on your slot's disk and could cause a 24 hour ban on accessing your cloud storage. It is _your_ responsibility to ensure usage is within acceptable limits. Ignorance is not an excuse.
:::

**Nextcloud** is a free and open-source suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. It was a fork of ownCloud and it has been actively developed by some of the original developers of ownCloud. In contrast to proprietary cloud providers like Dropbox, Office 365 or Google Drive, Nextcloud enables users to deploy their own file hosting server and have full control of their data.

For more information, visit [Nextcloud's home page.](https://nextcloud.com/)

In this section, we'll be installing and setting up Nextcloud for the first time. We'll be doing the following:

1.  Installing MariaDB and Nextcloud
2.  Creating an admin account
3.  Connecting MariaDB to Nextcloud

### Prerequisites

* Before installing nextcloud, you need to Install MariaDB first.
* Go to the Installers tab on the UCP and search for `mariadb`

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583220886423.png)

* Click install and type your preferred password
    * Make sure this password is unique from your other passwords

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583221042417.png)

* Once it's installed, go ahead and install Nextcloud.

### Creating Your Admin Account

* Once you installed Nextcloud and click Connect, you'll be taken to Nextcloud's initial setup wizard.
* First, create your own admin account by putting your preferred credentials
  * Make sure this password is unique from your other passwords

## Troubleshooting Information

**I am unable to upload files more than the size of 10MB on Nextcloud. How to resolve it?**

This is a default limitation of your nginx instance, as it is not needed by most of our clients. Run the following command to your slot’s shell to be able to upload more than 10MB.

```sh
sed -i 's|client_max_body_size .*;|client_max_body_size 0;|g' "$HOME"/.apps/nginx/nginx.conf && app-nginx restart
```

### Sharing and Syncing Files

In this section, we'll be configuring Nextcloud to share files. We'll be doing the following steps

1.  Enabling External Storage App
2.  Accessing SSH to get your seedbox's home path
3.  Setting up seedbox home as external storage in Nextcloud
4.  Adding files/folders
5.  Sharing files

We'll also guide you on how to sync your files to your device using Nextcloud's Sync Client.

#### Enabling External Storage App

* Login to your Nextcloud interface. Click the gear icon (1) and click **Apps** (2).

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583224035813.png)

* On the left-side panel, click **Disabled apps**

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583224114942.png)

*   Then find **External storage support**. Click **Enable**. It'll be removed from the list after it has been enabled.

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583224224872.png)

#### Getting Your Seedbox's Home Path

* Next, we'll be getting your seedbox's absolute path/home folder location. To do that, you need to login to your seedbox's SSH.
  * For more information on how to connect to your slot's SSH, refer to [How to connect to your seedbox via SSH](https://docs.usbx.me/books/secure-shell-%28ssh%29/page/how-to-connect-to-your-seedbox-via-ssh)
  * Once logged in, type in `echo $HOME`. The output will be your home folder. In this case, the output shown below is `/home1/usbdocs`. Copy that output.

```sh
usbdocs@lw701:~$ echo $HOME
/home1/usbdocs
usbdocs@lw701:~$
```

#### Setting Up Seedbox as External Storage

* Go back to your Nextcloud, click the gear icon and click **Settings**

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583227248462.png)

*   On the left-side pane, click **external storages** under Administration

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583227315662.png)

* Create new external storage with the following options:
  * **Folder name**: Can be anything you want. Here, we set it to USB Docs
  * **External Storage**: Local
  * **Authentication**: None
  * **Configuration**: Your home folder location
    * Paste the output of your SSH here
  * **Available for:** Leave blank if you are the only user on your Nextcloud. Otherwise select the users you want to have access to this folder.
  * **Enable sharing:** Check
  * **Read only:** Check if you want your folder to be read-only from Nextcloud. In the screenshot below, read-only is checked.
    * You can leave this unchecked this if you or your users want to add/edit/remove files or add folders

![](https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-03/scaled-1680-/image-1583227506003.png)

* Once that's done, click the check mark. You've set it correctly when a green check icon shows on the left side.
