## General Terms of Service

1. Any content or action taken on any Ultraseedbox plan is the responsibility of the client. Any actions taken out on a userspace, authorized by the client or not, will reflect on the client themselves. The user is required to follow all Terms of Service outlined here and will be referred to as “TOS” henceforth.

2. The user is responsible for ensuring their services are suitably secured as per the guidelines of our Password Policy. Ultraseedbox has no liability if the user account is compromised with weak passwords or sharing of an account with friends, family or any third person.

    * Tor relays/exit nodes
    * Hacking tools
    * Spamming tools
    * Phishing
    * Fraudulent gateways
    * Any malicious content that could reflect poorly on Ultraseedbox
    * Mining tools
    * Peer-to-peer load balancers

4. All user resources must be configured with authentication. This includes any applications and prohibits the use of open directories.

5. Payments made are the responsibility of the client. Any unpaid invoices will result in the service for the said invoice being suspended, with eventual termination and deletion of all data if left unpaid. Any over-payments due to incorrect PayPal subscriptions are non-refundable. These payments will be added to the client’s account as a credit to be used on future invoices.

6. Please treat staff with respect at all times. In return, we will treat clients with respect. Any client being excessively rude will risk being banned from Ultraseedbox.

7. The resale of any Ultraseedbox service or part thereof is strictly forbidden. Any user found to be reselling any services hosted on our slots will be immediately terminated with no refund given. This includes, but not limited to; selling access to any streaming application, hosting IPTV services on our slots or using our slots to distribute files in exchange for a payment.

8. Users are responsible for ensuring the safety of data stored on their Ultraseedbox slot. Our services are not redundant and data loss can occur. We recommend backing up any important files to dedicated cloud hosts.

9. Ultraseedbox reserves the right to alter prices, storage quantities, network rates, network volumes, and computational capabilities of all services at its sole discretion.

10. We reserve the right to amend the TOS outlined here at any point in time, continued use of our services is dependent on the client following all these terms.


## Account and Slot Responsibilities

It is the responsibility of the client to ensure the information kept on their slot is backed up and secure at all times. We strongly suggest backing important information up to an external cloud location; we are an apps hosting provider, not a storage provider. Drive failure can happen and we are unable to guarantee the information will be recovered. Ultraseedbox shall never be held liable for failure to recover data in the event of any sort of failure, and shall never be held accountable financially or otherwise for loss of data.

We also recommend using unique, secure passwords to be set for UCP, customer portal, SSH and all apps. Users should refer to our Password Policy. Any applications or content on our services that are not in line with our TOS will be considered a violation of our TOS, regardless of if an account was compromised.


## Sharing and Reselling

Allowing public access to our services is forbidden. This includes public http directories, hosting video streams or hosting public services. Any client found allowing public access to any services will be asked to stop, failure to comply will result in account termination.

Reselling of any aspect of our services is strictly forbidden. Any client found to be accepting money or other payments in exchange for any sort of access to our services will be immediately terminated and ineligible for a refund.


## Fair Usage

Our services run on shared resources, as a result, it is the responsibility of the client to ensure that their activities do not negatively impact other client’s experiences. All Clients must ensure that their resource consumption is within acceptable limitations. Ultraseedbox may stop, without warning, any applications that are negatively affecting other clients and has every right to regain control of the abused resource from users without prior notice. In extreme scenarios, the client’s slot may be suspended or terminated as the backbone of this policy is that everyone has a positive experience.

Ultraseedbox will not be liable nor responsible for any customer/user loss out of this arrangement, and there will not be any refund of customer paid fee. Users of all Ultraseedbox services agree not to interfere with other users in an unfair or malicious manner such that other users are not able to receive the due level of services. 


## Forbidden content

The following content is strictly forbidden:
* Tor relays and/or exit nodes
* Child pornography
* IPTV hosting or sharing
* VOD (Video on Demand) hosting services of any kind
* Kodi add-ons and repositories
* Publicly hosted files
* Any hacking tools

## Payments

Our billing procedure is structured to ensure that you must have adequate time to pay your invoices, which are sent 10 days prior to the due date of the service with an invoice reminder sent 3 days prior. A service with an unpaid invoice after midnight on the due date will be suspended, then reminders will be sent out on the 1st, 2nd and 5th day. With further course of action the slot will be terminated and all data will be deleted permanently after midnight of the 5th day if the invoice remains unpaid. Any payments past 5th day will result in a new slot being created, which is not ineligible for our refund policy.
