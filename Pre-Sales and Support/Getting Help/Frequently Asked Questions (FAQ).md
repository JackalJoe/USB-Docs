##### Are any BitTorrent trackers disallowed?

No, The only type of tracker we restrict is seeding to public ones. We ask you limit your public torrents to a ratio of 2. You can see how to do this on your respective clients here: [Deluge](https://docs.usbx.me/books/deluge/page/limiting-seeding-ratio-in-deluge), [ruTorrent](https://docs.usbx.me/books/rtorrentrutorrent/page/limiting-seeding-ratio-in-rutorrent) and [Transmission](https://docs.usbx.me/books/transmission/page/limit-seeding-ratio-in-transmission).

The download is not throttled, so you are free to download as much from public trackers as you wish.
