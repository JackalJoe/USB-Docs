All UltraSeedbox plans have complimentary VPN service included, which allows you to surf the web securely and anonymously by tunneling your internet traffic through your seedbox. We're using OpenVPN, a mature and secure VPN protocol.

This guide shows you how to get OVPN config files to be used to your OpenVPN clients and setting up OpenVPN clients.

***

## Setting Up UltraSeedbox VPN

* Login to your UCP and go to Access details
* Under OpenVPN access, you'll have 3 buttons which allows you to download 3 OVPN configs.
  * This means that you can connect up to 3 devices to your seedbox's VPN with each device having its own config.

* Download a config by clicking one of the 3 buttons. It'll download a zip file as {username}-{config number}.zip.
