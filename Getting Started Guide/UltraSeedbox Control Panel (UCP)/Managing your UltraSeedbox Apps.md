In this guide, we'll be showing you ways on managing your Ultraseedbox installable apps. This includes installing, uninstalling, upgrading and cleanup of the apps.

## Installing Apps

* To install an app, go to the Installers tab and just find the app that you want on the list.

* Some apps, like Medusa, asks for a password before installing.
* Once installed, your set password will be shown under Info. It will be hidden.

* Once that's done, you'll get a confirmation that the upgrade is finished. You may now access your apps again.

* For some apps such as Plex, we deploy a static image by default. Any attempts of upgrading to the latest version via the UCP will only reinstall said static image. However, you'll be able to upgrade said apps via SSH. Visit the following guides for more information

## Cleanup Installation

* In some cases, your installation/upgrade may fail and you'll get an error similar to this

```
/usr/bin/docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/{appname}-{username}" is already in use by container "fdcd401e1000424eb426cdef143cc07c". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name. See '/usr/bin/docker run --help'.
```

or

```
You will need to uninstall Plex in order to proceed with this installation.
```

* Go to **Installers** and click **Cleanup**

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/image-1592031962065.png"></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://docs.usbx.me/uploads/images/gallery/2020-06/image-1592032210916.png"></p>

* Once that's done, you'll get a confirmation that the cleanup is done. You may now install or upgrade your apps again.


## Uninstalling Apps

* To upgrade your app, go to the app you wish to **uninstall**.
* Click **Actions** and click **Uninstall**
